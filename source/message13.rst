Interpretation
--------------

.. todo::

   The operator defined in message 13 is for converting numbers from a grid form into a linear form. The linear encoding is [so far] unknown, but may be some form of [Variable-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity)

Decoded
