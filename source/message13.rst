Interpretation
--------------

The operator defined in message 13, *lin*, is for converting numbers from a grid form into a linear-encoded form. The linear encoding appears to be a type of [Variable-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity), with the following form:

*  Bits 0..1 define a positive or negative number [and signal width] via a high/low or low/high signal change
   * 01: positive number
   * 10: negative number
*  Bits 2..(n+2) define the width of the following binary-encoded number via a unary-encoded number of length *n* composed of high signals ending with a low signal. The number width (in bits) is four times the unary encoding (i.e. 4 * *n*).
   * 0: 0 [i.e. the number zero]
   * 10: 4-bit number [i.e. 1-7]
   * 110: 8-bit number [i.e. 1-255]
   * 1110: 12-bit number [i.e. 1-4095]
   * ...
*  The remaining bits, i.e. (n + 3)..(n + 3 + 4*n - 1), determine the number itself, in most-significant-bit first binary notation. Using the examples from message 13:
   * 0001: 1
   * 00010000: 16
   * 000100000000: 256
   * ...

With this encoding, the number zero only requires three bits (i.e. 010), but arbitrarily large numbers can also be represented.
