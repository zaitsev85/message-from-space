This image was produced from the eighth radio transmission using :doc:`previously contributed code <radio-transmission-recording>`.

This partly annotated version of the image was made using :ref:`code from message #3 <message3-code>`.

Interpretation
--------------

Contributed by Discord user @FiddlesticksMcGee.

Appears to designate a syntax for declaring variables.

Variables have a border of high values framing a negative of numbers as previously encoded in :doc:`radio-transmission-recording`.


Decoded
-------

.. literalinclude:: message8-decoded.txt


Code
----

Revised version of the Haskell code that supports the variable glyphs is published on the :ref:`message #3 page <message3-code>`.

Contributed by Discord users @pink_snow and @fryguybob.
